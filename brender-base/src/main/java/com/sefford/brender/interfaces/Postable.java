 * Postable interface done to abstract a notification interface from the Renderers.

 * This is done to separate the notification system from the renderer. Typically this is intended
 * to use it straightforward with an Event Bus as <a href="GreenRobot's">https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus</a> or
 * <a href="Square's Otto">http://square.github.io/otto/</a>.
 * <p/>
 * In this way the developer will be able to notify of UI events from the Renderer to upper layers of
 * the UI.
